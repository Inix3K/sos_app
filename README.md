# sos_app

SOS Multi-platform Application

## Getting Started

Initial implementation of this program will be a source for submitting and viewing feedback.

End goal is a one-stop source for all SOS related information, tying into the currently used Canvas system.

## PHASE 1

Initial app created with Flutter for Android and iOS compatibility.
Authentication implemented using Firebase.
Initial navigation scheme implemented.

## Todo

Navigation drawer should be pulled out from individual files and stored as a separate class.

Queries to Firebase databases needed:
- User account/profile information
- View feedback
- Specific class information as applicable for feedback submission form auto-fills.

Feedback form creation and tie-in to Firebase database

Syncing of Information between Firebase and Canvas
- Improve authentication to simplify user access between Canvas and the app
- Sync user profile
